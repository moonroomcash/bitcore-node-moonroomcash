Bitcore Node MoonroomCash
============

A Moonroomcash full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Configuration

Bitcore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your Bitcore Node.

```bash
bitcore-node create -d <bitcoin-data-dir> mynode
cd mynode
bitcore-node install <service>
bitcore-node install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
```

This will create a directory with configuration files for your node and install the necessary dependencies. For more information about (and developing) services, please see the [Service Documentation](docs/services.md).
